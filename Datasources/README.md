Data sources provide a way to make your Terraform configurations more flexible and dynamic by incorporating external data, and they are especially useful when you need to interact with resources that are not directly managed by Terraform.

By using data sources, you can ensure that your infrastructure configuration remains up-to-date with external resources and data, allowing you to manage your infrastructure more effectively.
